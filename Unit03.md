**Unit 3: Higher Level Techniques in CAD - Three-Dimensional Modeling**
<span id="3"></span> 
**You are now familiar with the 2D capabilities of the CAD program
(T-FLEX CAD) and know how to design basic 2D sketches and parts on your
computer.  With this background, you will learn how to create 3D models
from 2D sketches using various commands.  You will learn how to create
projections of your designs in order to put together functional, working
drawings or see how various parts will fit together in an assembly. 
T-FLEX CAD will enable you to arrange these parts in such a way that you
can see what the final, assembled product will look like.**
