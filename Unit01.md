**Unit 1: Engineering Graphics and Design** <span id="1"></span> 
*This first unit of the course will introduce you to the technical skill
of drafting. We will cover the design process along with various design
models. We will learn various methods of representing design like
orthographic projections, pictorial sketches, and isometric projections.
This unit will also cover other drawing representation techniques like
section views, auxiliary views, and solid modeling. Finally, we will
learn how to dimension and annotate the drawings with particular
attention to the creation of working and assembly drawings.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 44 hours to complete.
