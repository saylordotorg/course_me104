CAD, or computer-aided design, is a powerful modeling tool that
technical professionals use.  With CAD, architects can draw up building
plans and engineers can develop component and system designs.  Some CAD
programs even allow users to perform stress analysis, demonstrating how
well a proposed structure will fare when put to use.  For example, when
does a load become too big?  How much weight can be put onto a bridge
before it becomes structurally unsound?  Using CAD, professionals can
create precise engineering drawings in both 2- and 3-D, complete with
dimensions and specifications, in a neat and readable format.  This
modeling method has taken design to a whole new level of efficiency and
accuracy. We are fortunate to be engineers working in the current
era—one of computers, technology, and ease of precision.  Without CAD,
we would have to draft (or draw up) design blueprints by hand, which can
be tedious and time-consuming.  With CAD, however, we can generate
accurate 2-D and 3-D drawings, scaled as needed, with less effort and
less time.  Computer-aided design also provides us with a number of
other benefits.  For example, computer-generated drawings can be saved
for future editing so that engineers needn’t completely redraw them. 
Using CAD, engineers can model 3D parts and then fit them together in an
“assembly” view so that they can see beforehand how their products will
look.  Users can also rotate these technical drawings in order to view
them from any desired perspective. This course will introduce you to the
process of modeling 2- and 3-D objects with computer-aided design. 
Because all mechanical engineers should know how to draft by hand,
however, we will learn the basics of drafting as well.  The class will
wrap up with a CAD project in which you will select a mechanism—an ice
cream scoop or a can opener, for example—and model it on your computer. 
You will need to take precise measurements and utilize the skills and
navigation tools you have learned throughout the course as well.
**Note:** In this course, you will work extensively with Top Systems'
T-FLEX CAD software.  Before beginning this course, please download this
free software package according to the instructions below. To download
and install Top Systems' free T-FLEX CAD Student Edition software,
please select the link below and follow the instructions on the download
page. [T-FLEX CAD Student Edition
Download](http://tflex.com/student/download.htm) You will also need to
download and save the first two user manuals (PDF), "2D Design" and "3D
Modeling", both of which are available via the link above. You will use
these manuals extensively in units 2 and 3. You do not need to download
the "Tutorial" software or the additional manuals. Please abide by all
terms of the End User License Agreement. You will have to register this
product, free of charge, within thirty days of downloading it. Special
terms, system requirements, product limitations, and the EULA can all be
viewed at the link below. [Terms, limitations, & system
