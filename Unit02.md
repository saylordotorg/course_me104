**Unit 2: Introduction to CAD Two-Dimensional Modeling** <span
id="2"></span> 
**Now that you understand the basics of design, it’s time to enlist the
assistance of computer software to make the drawing process more
efficient.  Computer-aided design, or CAD, has become a staple of the
engineering world.  CAD programs allow you to create quick, detailed,
precise sketches of whatever machine or part you want to model.  Once
you become proficient in a specific program, you will be a great asset
for any company.  Having a strong working knowledge of CAD will open
doors for you as an professional engineer; with it, you can present not
only a written description of your idea but a visual representation as
well.*  
  
 *This unit will introduce you to the basics of computer-aided design. 
You will use T-FLEX CAD, which is freely available software that is
comparable to other modeling software like SolidWorks, ProEngineer, and
AutoDesk Inventor.  You will learn how to navigate the program and
create basic 2D models.**
