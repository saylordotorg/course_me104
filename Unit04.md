**Unit 4: CAD Project** <span id="4"></span> 
**You now know the basics of technical drawingandhow to use a CAD
programto create 2D and 3D sketches and models.  You are ready to create
your own working drawings, both by drafting and with CAD.  Provided with
the instructions for this project is an example that illustrates how to
assemblea pulley from its component parts.  This example is meant to
guide you through the steps of this project.  First, you will need to
create a 3D model of each part using T-FLEX CAD.  This will require you
to implement the techniques learned in Units 2 and 3.  Once you have
modeled the parts, you will need to assemble them using T-FLEX CAD.**

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 6.5 hours to complete.

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   Apply the skills attained from 2D and 3D modeling to design working
    drawings by using T-FLEX CAD.

-   **Activity: The Saylor Foundation’s “CAD Project”**

     Instructions: Please download the PDF file linked above to access
    the instructions for this project.  The second link contains T-FLEX
    files for an example project; review these in T-FLEX CAD to assist
    you in your own, original design.  When you select the link, a
    dialogue box will open; select a location to save the compressed
    folder.  Once you have downloaded the folder, open it and follow any
    instructions to extract (decompress) its contents.  Please note that
    the individual files will open in the T-FLEX CAD software
